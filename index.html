    <h3>The Famous Garden</h3>
    <p>Monetâ€™s garden is one of the most famous in the world. It's divided into two parts: the Clos Normand, in front of the house, and the Japanese-inspired water garden with its iconic lily pond. Monet found inspiration in these gardens, and they became the subject of many of his masterpieces, including the famous "Water Lilies" series.</p>
